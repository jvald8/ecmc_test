Assumptions:
Defining the last month as the last 30 days.
Options to get last month worth of IG photos.
1a. Need a way to see comments.
1b. Testing.
1. Assume there won't be more than 1000 tags in 30 days.
2. chose to search for text = #dctech, because noone uses tags in flickr
3. this is not a real time app, only refreshed when you refresh the page or search for a tag.
